Static positioning in CSS is the default position for HTML elements. It positions an element based on the page's normal flow, as it would be without any CSS styling. 
Static positioning doesn't render an element in any special way, but in a normal way. It's not affected by the top, right, bottom, or left properties. Z-index also doesn't apply to static elements. 
If you try to apply offset properties like top, bottom, right, and left to a square with the default static position applied to it, these properties will do nothing and the square will not move.
